# NWSH Shell

## What is Nwsh?
Nwsh, also called New Shell, is a modern implementation in C++ of a Unix shell centered in offering a lot of posibilities in terms of customization and some innovative features. Such as:
* Extensive theming. Layout/format of the prompt and colors can be modifyed separately.
* Theming on the run. Commands to change the theme can be run from the shell and there is no need to restart it in order apply them.

## What is the development stage of Nwsh?
It is still an early alpha, so don't expect to use it as a daily driver. However there are some interesting things already implemented:
* Basic Theming: a couple of formats available and a variety of colors to choose from.
* Basic shell usage: commands can be executed without problems and there are some in-built commands already implemented such as 'cd' and 'exit'.
* Configuration via config file located in ~/.nwshrc

## How can I theme my Nwsh?
There's an extensive guide about theming [here](themes).
